### Hello there! 👋

- 🏎 I’ve been driven by a passion for making life easier, mine and yours. 
- 🎓 I'm a graduate student at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am majoring in Information Systems Management. 
- 🔭 In the past, I've worked as a Consultant with Deloitte US-India. I worked in Data Analytics and automated a lot of boring stuff, saving loads of time for myself and my team.
- 🌱 My current journey is focussed at becoming a better problem solver using data. 
- 📚 I enjoy reading and Orwell's 1984 is one of my favorites. 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
